# SchemaCraft

SchemaCraft is a TypeScript library for simplifying the creation and management of JSON schemas. It's designed with large and nested schemas in mind, offering a programmatic approach for defining complex, dynamic, and highly reusable schemas while at the same time being very intuitive to read and understand at a glance.
